                            Term—by adjusting the relevant prompt. This allows you to switch the reference point for the

                            depending on the reporting context required.</p>

                        in a calendar-style view. For example if an absence starts from 1st July and ends on 31st, then

                        occurring on each day of the week. For example, if an absence started on the first day of the
                        week (Sunday by default) and ran for 7 days, then all the 7 cells of that week would show a '1'.

                    <p><b>Special Cause Improvement</b> is defined as a trend of X (defined using the prompt) data
                        points below the mean average OR X consecutively falling data points within the period.</p>

                    <p><b>Special Cause Concern</b> is defined as a trend of X data points above the mean average OR X
                        consecutively rising data points within the period. Only the last value of each trend is
                        highlighted on the graph.</p>

                    <p>Any data points outside the Upper and Lower Process Limits are also highlighted. Any values
                        falling within the range are In Control variation. Any values falling outside the range are Out
                        of Control variation.</p>

                    <p>Standard deviation is a number used to tell how measurements for a group are spread out from the
                        average (mean), or expected value. A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are
                        close to the average. A high standard deviation means that the numbers are more spread out.</p>
